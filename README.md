# Cluster_analysis - "Closeness Centrality"

In this challenge, suppose we are looking to do social network
analysis for prospective customers. We want to extract from
their social network a metric called "closeness centrality".
 
Centrality metrics try to approximate a measure of influence
of an individual within a social network. The distance between
any two vertices is their shortest path. The *farness*
of a given vertex *v* is the sum of all distances from each vertex
to *v*. Finally, the *closeness* of a vertex *v* is the inverse
of the *farness*.
 
The first part of the challenge is to rank the vertices in a given
graph by their *closeness*. The graph is provided in the attached
file; each line of the file consists of two vertex names separated by
a single space, representing an edge between those two nodes.

* It uses Breadth-First Search in Python to find the minimum paths. I used this algorithm because I have implementend it before using C language for another project (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z3y2hkQD74).
